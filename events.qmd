## December 7th UQRUG Drop-in

We've pushed back this month's UQRUG to December 7th due to clashes with end of year events.

Our main purpose is to serve as a drop-in help session for help with R and RStudio, but to keep things interesting we will briefly highlight a useful tool, function or package each week.

This week Nick will be briefly going over creating animated and interactive plots in R using the packages [gganimate](https://gganimate.com/) and [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/animations/).
