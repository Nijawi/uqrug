## February 22th UQRUG Drop-in

Our main purpose is to serve as a drop-in help session for help with R and RStudio, but to keep things interesting we will briefly highlight a useful tool, function or package each week.

This week Nick will be briefly going over how to create a customisable online form in R using the [googlesheets4](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/) and [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) packages.
