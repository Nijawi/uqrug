UQRUG is a **gathering for R users of all skills**, to help each other solve problems, to share resources and tips, and to simply hang out with a nice community.

We meet **every last Wednesday of the month** (12-2 pm, currently online and in person): sign up to the next event on the [Library training page](https://web.library.uq.edu.au/library-services/training)

You can find our monthly [Collaborative Document here](https://demo.hedgedoc.org/s/HJCLW3fWU).

For more information, reach out to the UQ Library training team: training@library.uq.edu.au
