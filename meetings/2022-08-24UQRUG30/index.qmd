#### Topics discussed and code

How to read multiple csv files in as separate variables efficiently for a Shiny app.
Looked at creating a list of files, and then using the read_csv function in rdrr package to read them in.

Tried a lapply(files,read_csv) but this just creates a list of the files.
Found a package known as easycsv which has a function called loadcsv_multi()

```
loadcsv_multi(directory)
```
