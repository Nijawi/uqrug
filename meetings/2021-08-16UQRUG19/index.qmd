#### Code snippets

Change the order of categorical variable levels (so ggplot2 uses that order instead of the alphabetical order):


```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
                          
# relevel factors using forcats package
library(forcats)
f <-  factor(c("a", "b", "c", "d"), levels = c("b", "c", "d", "a"))
fct_relevel(f, "a", "c", "d", "b")

# relevel eye_color of starwars data

starwars %>% 
   mutate(eye_color = fct_relevel(eye_color, "yellow")) %>% 
   ggplot(aes(x = eye_color)) +
   geom_bar()
```

Use case_when to rate or recode data:


```{r}
library(dplyr)

starwars
range(starwars$height, na.rm = TRUE)

# just based on height
starwars_rated <-  starwars %>% 
   mutate(height_rating = case_when(height < 70 ~ "very small",
                                    height < 140 ~ "quite small",
                                    height < 200 ~ "medium",
                                    TRUE ~ "tall"))                                       
                                    
# recode based on multiple conditions
range(starwars$mass, na.rm = TRUE) # check range of mass, second vairable to recode by

starwars_rated <-  starwars %>% 
   mutate(height_rating = case_when((height < 70) & (mass < 700)~ "very small and light",
                                    height < 140 ~ "quite small",
                                    height < 200 ~ "medium",
                                    TRUE ~ "tall"))
          
```
