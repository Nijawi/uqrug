In this special edition of UQRUG we will be at [ResBazQld](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2023qld/) (at the special date and time of **Wed 22nd Nov, 3-5pm**). For our overview we will be looking at some **Cool but Useless** ways we can use R. 
From creating emoji art, to using memes in ggplot2, to playing sounds when our code is complete. 

Coding and acaedmia can get stuffy and work focused, so this month we're going to play with some more entertaining R packages, which can hopefully make the learning process a bit more interesting.
