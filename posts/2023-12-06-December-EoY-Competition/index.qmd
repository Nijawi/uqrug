In this special End of Year edition of UQRUG we will be holding a **competition** to see who can create the **Coolest and Most Useless R code** (on the special date of **Wed 6th Dec, 12-2pm**). We're looking for creativity and entertainment value, so perhaps you'll find a hilarious use of an R package, or maybe you can chain together an entertaining string of functions.

For examples of things you could submit, please see [last Month's slides](https://uqrug.netlify.app/presentations/23-11-cool/23-11-cool.html). 

The winner will be chosen by those attending the next UQRUG. They will not only receive the honourable title of **“Coolest and Most Useless”**, but also the UQRUG Rug! All other entrants will receive a prize too!

To apply, simply show up to UQRUG on December 6th (or send me an email beforehand with your code if you can't make it)!
