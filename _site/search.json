Feel free to add links too, so others can have a look and contribute.\n\nSteph (Library) - putting together a resource for learning reproducible reports with R Markdown.\nGreg - working on my PhD thesis using RMarkdown (I have converted the UQ thesis template to RMarkdown). Also working on some data analysis which involves manipulating data contained in multiple files. Lots of dplyr code. Note: R 4.0 coming this week. This is a major release and it involves reinstalling all of your packages. Be careful if you update and make sure you keep backups.\nPatrick - Honours student in agriculture using R to analyse biomass of lettuce and genetic variations of weed species.\nAljay - Working in fruit/vegetable quality changes in supply chains and using R to predict changes in the chain.\nFathiyya - Currently I am working in remote sensing field for group of crops classification using R\nPaula - I’m here to help with questions.\nAmelia - Hello! I am a basic learner of R. I will start plotting some graphs, and if I have some questions I will let you know.\nDebbie - Postdoc at SEES using R for catchment restoration projects. We can create breakout rooms in Zoom for people to help each other.\n\n\n\nTopics discussed\n\nR 4.0 released in a few days.

He showed some examples of how these can be used to make your graphs somewhat more interesting, and in the case of plotly, interactive. gganimate plotly\nChuan questions about using barplot Chuan was using a barplot to show data which referred to the responses of multiple species across a number of tests. When using the same code for a slightly different sample group, the colours on the chart changed. We spent some time trying to find the cause of this, such as slight differences in the code, but we didn’t come to a solution. We will next try converting the data to fit into a ggplot.\nOlive Dang ggplot2 legend order Olive needed help changing the order of some variables in a ggplot legend. We accomplished this by turning that column of the dataframe into a facotr with levels. E.g. :\ndf$col &lt;- factor(df$col, levels=c('a', 'b', 'c'))\nOlive Dang ggplot2 and ggarrange making all the graphs the same size Olive had a second question about ggplot when exporting them onto the same page. There was an issue where they weren’t lining up very well (the top graph was smaller). We spent some time trying to resolve this issue, however, it turns out that there is an argument in ggarrange which allows you to quickly make them the same size. The align argument allows you to align graphs along the vertical axis, horizontal axis, or both.\nAinnatul Adawiyah Ahmad Termizi on using R over Excel Ainnatul wanted to recreate some graphs and statistical analyses that had been made in Excel in R. We recommended checking out some of the introduction to R classes that we run, as well as the ANOVA class that we have a guide for."
